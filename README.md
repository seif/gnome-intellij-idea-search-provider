# Gnome shell search provider for Intellij Rider projects

A Gnome shell extension to find recent IntelliJ Rider projects in search.

## Requirements

- Gnome shell 3.34 or newer
- Python 3.6 or newer (as `python3` in `$PATH`)

## Installation

Install via [Gnome Extensions][gexts].

Alternatively download the latest `.shell-extension.zip` from [Releases] and run

```console
gnome-extensions install intellij-rider-search-provider@seifattar.net.shell-extension.zip
```

**Note:** Version numbers from Gnome Extensions and Releases differ, because
uploading to Gnome Extensions renumbers releases. If you switch between
installation methods, remove and reinstall.

## Limitations

- I do not know how to parse XML in GJS, so finding recent IntelliJ projects
  relies on a Python helper which parses `recentProjects.xml` and outputs
  relevant parts as JSON (see [GH-1]).

## Credits

I'd like to thank [gnome-shell-web-search-provider][1] and [vscode-search-provider][2]
for inspiration and their source code which demonstrates how to use the—apparently
entirely internal and undocumented—Gnome shell API for search providers.

Stand on the shoulders of giants and you can even write Javascript for Gnome.
